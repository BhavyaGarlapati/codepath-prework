**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program.

Submitted by: **Bhavya Garlapati**

Time spent: **7** hours spent in total

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [ ] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
- [ ] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked.
- [ ] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked.
- [ ] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
- [ ] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess.
- [ ] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
- [ ] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
- [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
- [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] None

## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

    I used google search engine to troubleshoot some github access issues I was initially having, and was able to figure it out
    on my own! I was copying the wrong repo link which is why my work wasn't exporting from glitch.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
   
   One of the challenges I encountered during this project was keeping track of the various steps required to implement each feature. 
   To be more precise, how I needed to add lines of code to not only one file, but different lines for design and usability in 
   each file (index, script, and style). My knowledge of HTML/CSS is barely if any, and none with JavaScript. I really appreciated 
   how this prework focused on candidates teaching themselves and adapting to new material and software. It was more meaningful 
   than high stress test of our knowledge. With my experience in Java and Python, I was able to mostly understand what lines of 
   code meant, but sometimes could not figure out why they were there. If I ran into small errors, I made sure to not only 
   analyze the lines I had just inputted but also cross check functionalities in script.js with the index.html file. 
   I also made sure I read and reread the optional drop-down readings on the prework instructions for any explanations given. 
   A big part of understanding the code was also understanding the embedded packages and functions. I would often get 
   overwhelmed thinking about hardcoding every detail, but then realized glitch and coding languages have evolved to simply this. 
   If I did not understand a package or function from the prework instructions, I would google it to see a basic definition 
   and style of how it works.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   
   After completing my submission, I have thought of a few questions involving security and design. My first question is, 
   how does cybersecurity software work with webpage code to protect the website and its users? Do web developers imbed 
   their own cybersecurity within the webpage code or is it an entirely different program and system that works cohesively 
   with the webpage code? Is it possible or necessary for me to imbed any sort of security for the Sound and Memory game if 
   I was launching it onto a public server? I have taken an introductory course to cybersecurity in my university, and it is
   an area of expertise I would like to dive deeper into. My next questions are about implementing individual and purchased designs. 
   Are there different functions/packages to implement different types of icons? Is it cheaper/easier for an individual to 
   hardcore designs with HTML/CSS or for them to use a pre-designed website through companies such as Wix and Weebly?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   
   If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would have focused on making it into a more traditional video game like webpage including multiple page shifts, more reactive buttons, and rewards. I would like to have a colorful home page with clearer instructions, images/characters, and a larger start button. After the user clicks start with a “cursor character” of their choice, the user would be taken to a new screen with a range of buttons to select a level (which will include more of the optional features), exit/back buttons, and a start game button which will finally take the user to the last screen for the game they created with the level and character selected based on their user input. Also, a countdown so the pattern doesn’t begin as abruptly. If time permitted, I would also like to create a point reward system. Points would be awarded based on the duration of the game and the number of wins a user scored in a row. These points could then be used as an incentive for users to return. Points earned could be used to unlock more “cursor characters” and levels. Overall, this system could encourage users to stay and play the game longer and make the experience more appealing to various demographics. This all may take more than a few hours, but I would try to implement as many working aspects as possible to make this project more multi-dimensional.
